# Vaccine Efficacy Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains a Python-based project for predicting the most efficient type of vaccine using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project utilizes Google Colab for ease of development and collaboration.
the data taken from Kaggle.

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict the most efficient type of vaccine based on given input features using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. KNN is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It classifies a new data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher is required.
Basic understanding of machine learning concepts.
Familiarity with K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

## Technologies Used
#### Python 3.7
#### K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the notebooks directory using Google Colab or your preferred Jupyter environment.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train the KNN model.
Make predictions on new data.
Customize the model hyperparameters, preprocessing steps, and data sources according to your needs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should be provided by the user. It should contain relevant features that help predict the efficiency of different vaccine types. Make sure to preprocess the dataset as required for training the KNN model.
